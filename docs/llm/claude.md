this project uses dotnet windows. 
original source is https://github.com/TanmayCzax/AETHRA
however I am on fedora linux. 
what are my options for running this on fedora linux? 
I have included the latest dump in `dump.txt`
please read each and every line of the code 
don't skim it 
don't try to change the coding style 
don't remove braces around the if 
don't change the primary constructor back to whatever you did 
don't make unnecessary changes 
do make the code build, 
do make the tests pass 
and do make everything work properly 
and follow engineering best practices 
and please do not hallucinate 
give me full files for all files that changed 
oh and for everything we change, the unit tests and the integration should still pass 
remember we don't want to cause any regressions 
thank you and please take as long as necessary to think 
do not rush 
do not hallucinate 
if there is a clear best way to accomplish this, please give me the full implementation
