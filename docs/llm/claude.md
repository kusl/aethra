Can you please generate me github actions to generate full size (no trimming, no removing dependencies to reduce file size, nothing like that) binaries for all major desktop platforms with every single push? 
no, not pre-release 
full releases 
with every single push 
yes, I mean it 
I have included the latest dump in `dump.txt`
please read each and every line of the code 
don't skim it 
don't try to change the coding style 
don't remove braces around the if 
don't change the primary constructor back to whatever you did 
don't make unnecessary changes 
do make the code build, 
do make the tests pass 
and do make everything work properly 
and follow engineering best practices 
and please do not hallucinate 
give me full files for all files that changed 
oh and for everything we change, the unit tests and the integration should still pass 
remember we don't want to cause any regressions 
and we definitely do not want to cause data loss on existing deployments now that we have two deployments 
in the future, we will also explore deploying these on a local machine, virginia, and having the blog or at least a development instance of the blog available by try cloudflare tunnel service 
but for now lets clean up our code, tighten up the user experience on mobile, fix the share sheet if anything needs to be fixed, and add or fix any test cases that need to be changed or added 
thank you and please take as long as necessary to think 
do not rush 
do not hallucinate
